Notes
* Food:
  * Dropping the item gets weird... Item goes to the sky
  * Sometimes item isn't chained!? (Investigate signalpipes? Might be because of AIModifier not working)
  * AIModifier is also not working
  * need to stop them eating if the bowl is destroyed
  * Add chopsticks
  * Remove chef checking bowl action
* Does ConsumeFromInventory work on AI?
* Set amulet to kinematic
* Sniper
  * Convert to a new entity
  * Needs to fire in open combat
  * Doesn't stop firing?!?
* Panic needs to be if they get to a guard, not just out of zone? (...or like PZ? Spreads to anyone they contact? But contacts aren't valid targets - just can't leave with them alive. Force loss of SA and cleanup)
* Lock the gate to the back of the restaurant?



* Remove test items (serving plate, poison)
* Fix amulet place (delivery) position & rotation
* Unset default spawn
