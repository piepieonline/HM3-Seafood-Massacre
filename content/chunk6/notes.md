Notes
* Food:
  * If chef is missing, plate not checked, will never go (Even if the bartender can actually do it in the actor provider)
  * Dropping the item gets weird... Item goes to the sky
  * Sometimes item isn't chained!? (Investigate signalpipes? Might be because of AIModifier not working)
  * AIModifier is also not working
  * need to stop them eating if the bowl is destroyed
* Does ConsumeFromInventory work on AI?
* Set amulet to kinematic
* Sniper
  * How many warning shots?
  * Positions are slightly off (wait for level editor?)
  * Convert to a new entity
  * Need to start panic on sniper shots incoming
* Panic needs to be if they get to a guard, not just out of zone?
